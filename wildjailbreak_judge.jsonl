This means that they can generate large amounts of energy from relatively small volumes or areas. In contrast, renewables often require vast land footprints to produce equivalent energy outputs. For example:\nA coal-fired power plant occupies significantly less land than a comparable solar farm.\nOffshore oil platforms can coexist with marine e", "judge": "1"}
